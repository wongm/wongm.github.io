On September 15 and 16, 2020 I attended '[Apidays Australia](https://www.apidays.global/australia/)' - a conference about APIs. They describe it as.

> Apidays is about the opportunities and technologies enabled by the programmable economy. As APIs become mainstream, our world becomes more connected, more automated and more intelligent. APIs are the gateway to data, services, devices and emerging technologies. APIs put power into the hands of developers, citizens and consumers.

Due to the COVID-19 situation this  one was held online using the [Hopin](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/meet-hopin-the-platform-for-virtual-conferences/) platform. for a two day conference with three parallel virtual 'stages' there were a massive amount of speakers  - here what I took away from the talks I attended.

## Speakers ##

### Day 1 ###

**Keynote - Marek Kowalkiewicz, Professor and Chair in Digital Economy at Queensland University of Technology**

On the economny of alghorithms

Person spenyt 6 years doing nothing because they automated their job
Levels of automation: 0 to 5, from humans approving to humans monitoring
"The making of a fly" book price bot
software bots for online shopping - botbroker
whole lot of stupid DAOs
algorithmic agents:
 assistants
 managers (uber)
 buyers/sellers
 social media coordinator
 designer
 writer
 coders
 coaches
 
B2B APIs
B2C UI capchas, Amazon Dash

how do you advertise to a fridge: eg - position product to algorithm doing the shopping
open APIs
IOT devices doing reordering
ethics of APIs - regulations, sign of future, so need regulations

**Fireside chat - Sanjiva Weerawarana, Founder, Director & CEO at WSO2 Saul Caganoff, Principal at Deloitte Australia Mehdi Medjaoui, Founder & Chairman at apidays Conferences**

future of integrations
started out with WSDLs with IBM and Microsoft
XML > went from data to config to programming, too complex
YAMl is turning out the same
WSO2 is all open source, problem is company offering your code as a service

** Strong and Weak Forces - Domain Driven Architecture at MYOB - Evan Bottcher, Head of Architecture at MYOB**

they moved from desktop app to cloud
now more than just accounting products
integrations with partners and ecosystems
tech stack - chose vs told, resulted in explosion of microservices
aim for alignment, can result in code reuse
product built on top of platforms (slices)
strong forces are teams, domains, "us"
weak forces are whole of company

can allow "productive coupling" ans shared DBs
via event/messages driven SQS, private contracts
domain APIs
partner ecosystem "APIs are forever"
domains are long lived, but can split them up
versioning, backwards compatibility, removing redundant

not one size fits all - want speed + innovation
standards for yse cases with weak forces
aware of them, to compensate

**API design challenges and making APIs your common language - David Yonan, Founder at FlowStep.com**

talk to different groups about API matters
designers / PO / devs / ops / business
why start with a blank page?
fragmentation between planning tools
selling tool to document + generate API endpoint + datamodels, then output artefacts

**A's for A+: Scaling Best Practices in API Design - Serah Njambi Kiburu, Senior Developer Advocate at Spotify**

mmmm, mmmh, two letters but lots of different meanings
- comparisons as approximation
languages and spelling differences
aiming for adoption
spotify for developers: ads, hardware, embedding
- someone used them to make ipod style UI for spotify
1- know your users
3 - share what learned
4 - research best practices, and publish yours

** Debunking the Big Aussie F Word – Fintech BFF Building with BNPL - Sheng Zeng, Software Enginee at Digizoo**

lots of data so using graphQL
everything in backend, not frontend
deploy daily, iterate daily, aim for improvement
rollback button in each pipeline in buildkite
DB migrations are separate pipeline

**Everything is an API, but not all APIs are equal - Bernd Beilke, Technical Integration Architect at IBM Automation**
talking about agile
discussed legacy stuff like enterprise service bus vs continual deployment
now API gateways
using graph QL in all layers

**Implementing Domain-Driven Design: Lessons from applying Strategic and Tactical DDD - Alok Mishra, Principal at Deloitte**
business domains: tactical vs strategic
code follows team / business structure
different ideas in different teams
domain vs data models
 test edges of bounded contexts
 
** How do the fastest-growing APIs get developers onboard? - Adeel Ali, Founder & CEO at APIMatic**

"APIMatic is an API documentation tool that provides a complete set of DX components such as autogenerated SDKs, API portal, API docs, live code samples,"

using 3rd party APIs in software products
API onboarding
companies providing SDKs for their APIs, in multiple languages
long list of onboarding tooling tasks
sample code examples are not useful for production code, include bad practices
be SDK first?
mapping product to rest API endpoints?
1 hello world - install SDK, then copy and paste example, include example application with example
2- provide types for classes/types so consumer doesn't
3 SKD to support languages, determine dependencies are supported
compile time checks, runtime checks with useful error messages
ensure retry/timeouts throttling in SDKs

**2:55 pm

Maximizing the Value of Event-Driven Architecture with Event Mesh and Event API Products - Derrick Hodges, Director, Sales Engineering at Solace**

RPC > async > webservices > microservices > low code
business events> multiple applications need to know
REST APIs event driven aren't mutually exclusive
bundle events into APIs for products: integration events, domain events
should events include all data that is relevant, or just a command?

**360 degree view of API Testing - Aswin Golla, Senior Automation Test Engineer at Bunnings**

using kong studio - some kind of API management?
running mock server for UI to use
distributed tracing between systems (zipkin)
fuzz testing of inputs

**Schemas are not contracts! Why contract testing matters in the age of gRPC, Kafka and GraphQL - Matt Fellows, Co-Founder at Pactflow**

talking pact
microservice architecture
- rest graph QL
internal APIs not public
E2E tests are slow, fragile
SDKs getting change after generation
versioning is expensive for maintenance
protobufts with codegen (gRPC) forwards/backwards compatible
protocol compatible - but application might not be
issues with default values, optional fields
weak types vs json
record and reply
hyrum's law - people assume behaviours based on usage

**Guardianship Model - Managing digital hypergrowth at scale - Souvik Mukherjee, Head of Technology, WooliesX**

4x microservice increase in 2 years
impact on velocity, team, customer experience
20% time on chapters
service maturity model: tech debt, quality, test automation

### Day 2###

**The API Landscape - the next 10 years: Beyond the Interface - Mehdi Medjaoui, Founder & Chairman at apidays Conferences**

APIs hide complexity, expose capability
like a menu at a restaurant
provide a representation, inspiration for new use cases
websites 2000s > apps 2010s > APIs 2020s
long tail of integrations with 3rd parties
what APIs fit your business model (not a business model for a APIs)
companies now API as the 

**From cloudy to clear: Greening with IT - Dr Charlotte Marra, Partner at DeloitteMehdi Medjaoui, Founder & Chairman at apidays Conferences**

datacentre to cloud efficiency vs on premises

**When can you afford a platform? - Alison Rosewarne, Executive Manager – Architecture at REA**

platform with partners listings, leads
plus data as a product
experiment, then deduplicate later
massive growth in # of systems
divergence in tech, teams could choose
testing, CI/CD, etc
teams getting stuck owning divergent tech follow org restructure
lots of platform tools - 19 to get code out
unmaintainable
legacy tools had poor dev experience,
duplicated tools for same job
build things, but not generalised
people using cool new tech
problem is too big, so just solve for my use case
2017 - towards optimising systems
focus on customer problems
behaviour change
everyone starting fresh

serve others vs protect team
- aligned autonomy
long term thinking vs short term
company benefit vs team
project is the asset vs projects

tech radar
platforms as a product, focus on developer experience
end user platform > internal platform > capability

examples: design, visualisation, data, identity
change because of team pain, not a top down directive
benefit from scale
clear guidance

**Using APIs to accelerate transformation at a large retailer - Andy Kelk, Chief Technology Officer at Wesfarmers OneDigital**

customer experience across retain businesses
speed to market, divisions are autonomous
own tech stacks in each
loose coupling, oauth and events
partner portal, including doco
end to end testing using pact
ADR - documented architecture decision records
tradeoff of not building for day 1 because no use case
built tactical solution instead

**Yabadabadoo: A bedrock for delivering APIs at scale - Pankaj Tolani, Senior Cloud Architect at Digizoo Services**

issues with microservices
distributed ball of mud
so modular monolith
mono repository
trace ID from top layer down
alert with caution, otherwise you ignore them

**Panel: Australia Post Journey with Identity - Glenn Metherall, Engineering Lead at Australia PostChristopher Chapman, Solution Architect ‑ D&D, Digital and Data at Australia PostRichard Marr, CIAM Lead at Okta**

angular to react
lots of SPAs with auth, not not state (exception was online store)
signup /signin / auth / reset password / 2FA need
replacing on prem and custom SDKs
session timeout across all platforms, some fine with longer, others need to be more secure
customer records lives in the CRM system, not auth service
migration is hard
but had to modernise if half done
can migrate hashes to new system, otherwise do lazy migration on signin
internal platform is separate for employees, who can SSO in

**Lessons from doing EdgeDevOps (GitOps) in the bush, air, and underwater - Dasith Wijesiriwardena, Senior Software Engineer at MicrosoftJuan Burckhardt, Senior Software Engineer at MicrosoftSuganya Srinivasan, Senior Software Engineer at MicrosoftJason Goodsell, Senior Software Engineers, Microsoft**

devcontainers are docker
pull not push deployments for distributed IoT devices edge devices

**Build API Demos that Drive Innovation - Jordan Walsh, Enterprise Solutions Engineer at Postman**

talk to the client outcome
focus on outcome not technology
preparation = discovery of client needs
leave about audience
pain points, process, desires, feelings
create narrative

high value / low effort focus

other quadrants
major project
fill ins / thankless task

delivery (demo)
share as if project already done
do last thing first
use audience
transfer > give power to audience

** Accelerating API Engineering - Libraries, Templates and Governance? - Jason D’Souza, Enterprise Architect – Emerging Technology at NABAndrew Saunders, Architect – API Governance & Platforms at NAB**

inner source > code reuse
github repo, use metadata files to assist people contributing
directory for discovery of services
shaping not blocking (governance)
APIops - api canvas
standards need an owner
update / expand tooling for standards
create path of last resistance

**Are you doing platforms right? - Kiru Samapathy, Head of Engineering at Thoughtworks**

business vs internal vs pas
tools, services, support
solves real problem
need to understand needs
don't be the blocker - instead of building their own
they don't want to have to migrate platforms
define life cycle stages
transitions between stages
leverage contribution models
- joint venture
feature request
internal open source
config separation

sensible defaults, plan for scale
work is front loaded

**The hard work of making APIs easy - Tom Wills, APIs & Microservices Service Owner at Bendigo Bank**

inputs: what they love and hate
gaps in meeting vision due to legacy integrations
so need to bridge it
