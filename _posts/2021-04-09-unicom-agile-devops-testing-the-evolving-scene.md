On 18 and 19 March 2021 I attended '[UNICOM Agile, DevOps & Testing: The Evolving Scene](https://www.unicomlearning.com/2021/ADT-March/)' - a conference about APIs. They describe it as.

> "The uncertainty in the current working world has brought in new processes and digital products. The evolving changes in these three areas – Agile, DevOps and Testing - are discussed and examined as to the viability for their adoption. Join in the discussions and share the practical knowledge sharing experiences.

Due to the COVID-19 situation this one was held online using the [FLOOR](https://floor.bz/) platform. Here what I took away from the talks I attended.

There is so much more to quality than just testing. It is not just bugs we need to look out for, but also the UX should be high quality for the users.

When I talk to the teams, I would rather talk about how we ensure good quality for our products, than just about which tests we need to do.

## My thoughts overall ##

Normally my main driver for attending conferences is the free food and swag, but that doesn't work online. But luckily for me, there were still plenty of worthwhile talks to listen to from home.  

Kubernetes and GraphQL were popular topics across the conference, but they aren't technologies I use in my day job, but it was interesting to see what they do compared to the alternative technologies I do use.

Business buy-in and event sourcing were also up and coming subjects, both of which I haven't quite nailed at work, so seeing other opinions on the subject was valuable.
