The other day I was looking over some unit tests for a date formatting code that handles both US and Australian locales, and noticed the test data being used - January 1. Not exactly a good choice, because even if your code is broken, the output looks the same as if it was working!

My solution was to change it to use January 31 instead - because there's no such thing as a 31st month! ðŸ˜„
