incident response - pager duty

- unplanned disruption that affects users
- handling issues, not necessary solving
- replace chaos with calm


incident command system 

- not just IT

minor incidents:

- known failures
- responsibility of small team
- not urgent

major

- surprise
- cross functional

starts with just a responder
bringing in coordinator, scribe, communicator as severity increase

anyone can trigger incident response process
not waiting for metrics
because you might thing issue will get worse

when in major incident, might allow deploying of code without tests

command:
commander
scribe / deputy
liasons:
internal / customer liasons
operations:
SMEs

commander doesn't so stuff. they delegate. also ensure stuff gets documented
but need consensus
ask for strong objections, instead of agreement
shields / buffers SMEs from outsiders

avoid abbreviations
cleaner rather than concise
if no commander, then you are :-P

what are risks - time vs impact

assign to specific person
not to group, as it might get missed
timebox tasks to follow up
if not enough, ask for new amount

deputy
not just following along
takes on extra tasks
follows up reminders, ensure items not missed
but also standby

capture data for followup / post mortem
allowed to add extra details as needed, not just stenographer
logging as it is happening

liason
typically support team member
notifying customers in appropriate language
are updates too frequent - think about it?

set definitions
create runbooks

postmortem
not punishment
for learning from incident
blameless
how instead of who
anyone can do it
what and how instead of who and why
physiological safety helps
