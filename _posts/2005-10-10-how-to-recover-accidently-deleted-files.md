<p>Have you ever accidently deleted a file and then needed it again? </p>
<p>Simple, just go to the Recycle Bin, and grab it out. </p>

<p>Ever hit Shift + Delete at the same time?</p>
<p>That deletes the file right away, but asks you if you are sure.</p>

<p>But this is what I did today. I had a bunch of file on my removable hard drive, and right clicked the mouse to select &quot;Rename&quot; But I hit &quot;Delete&quot; instead. No problem you say. Except for the fact with removable drives, the Recycle Bin is bypassed, and there is no confirmation box. Off into the ether, my hard work went...</p>

<p>It was a program I wrote in Java at uni, and it took ages. Java is an extremely annoying programming language. Using it to write programs, is like hammering in nails with a rubber hammer... (it looks like the right tool for the job, but in reality is totally hopeless at it)</p>

<p>So I spent an hour or so trying to find a free program to undelete it. There are plenty of shareware ones, which finds the files, butt you need to pay money to actually recover them.</p>
<p>And then I found <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/restoration.html">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/restoration.html</a>Totally free!</p>

<p>However, the Author's website seems MIA.</p>

<p>But the download still works. And it fixed my problem in less than a minute. Good times...(and no redoing crappy Java...)</p>


<p>Linky again here...</p>

<p>Or a direct download...</p>
