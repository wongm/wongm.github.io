I found this in my Akismet spam bin the other day.

They write:

<blockquote>Do you have a spam issue on this blog; I also am a blogger, and I was curious about your situation; we have developed some nice methods and we are looking to trade strategies with others, why not shoot me an e-mail if interested.</blockquote>

The purpose of their comment is to slip in a link to their website: an online store selling acne cream.

Searching Google for that comment gives me the a few hundred other blogs overrun by the exact same comment spam.

For goodness sake people: <a href="http://akismet.com/" target="_blank">Akismet</a> is free for personal use, and kills spam dead. In the past 60 days I have had 1,832 spam comments blocked from my blog, with a 99.68% accuracy rate - these days there is no reason for seeing spam on your blog.

<em>So how do you cope with comment spam? Post in the comments!</em>
